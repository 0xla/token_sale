# token_sale

This project involves the development of an ERC-20 Token named "Catrix Coin" (CRX) using the development environment Truffle. It is currently deployed on the Rinkeby Test Network and you can check out the Token Sale Website at the link https://lakshya021.github.io/token_sale/ and buy some if you would like, using test Ether ofcourse!

In case you don't have any test ether, you can find some at the link https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby without any hassle. You just need to put in your account address.

P.s - You need to have a Metamask Wallet browser plugin for the Token Sale website to work.
